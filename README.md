# Automating Basic Data Wrangling With the `clean_dataframe()` Function
This repository provides a Python function—called `clean_dataframe()`—that automates the basic data wrangling of a given dataframe. The Jupyter Notebook provides simple documentation for the said function and an example of using it. Copy the code for my function if you want to use it to clean your dataframe. 

# Problem
Data cleaning is a necessary part of data analysis. We need to ensure that our dataset is wrangled properly because the accuracy of our analysis and visualization depends on the accuracy of the data themselves. However, some processes of data wrangling are repetitive. Can we streamline our data preparation? 

# Plan
With the help of Pandas, I have to code a Python function that answers this problem. In this way, I can process a given dataset in Python, create its dataframe and pass it to the `clean_dataframe()` function. From here, I can either continue analyzing it in Python or save the cleaned dataframe into a .csv or .xlsx file. The cleaned dataset can then be loaded into Excel, Power BI, or Tableau to make an analysis and a dashboard.
